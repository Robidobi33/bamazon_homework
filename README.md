This app allows the user to view store products within a database and choose which item they would like to purchase.  Once the item is chosen the user can then decide how many and the total price is displayed.  If the user chooses a quantity that exceeds the current amount they will recieve a notification that the order cannot be completed.  Once an order is placed the database will be updated and if the user decides to place a new order, the correct items in stock will be displayed.
