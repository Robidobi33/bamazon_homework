Once the item is chosen the user can then decide how many and the total price is displayed.  If the user chooses a quantity that exceeds the current amount they will recieve a notification that the order cannot be completed.  Once an order is placed the database will be updated and if the user decides to place a new order, the correct items in stock will be displayed.",
